# Consumer-Complaint-Resolution-Analysis

This is my 2nd mini project perfomed in internship in Edureka.

Objective: Predict whether a customer is disputed or not based on given data using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Sklearn.

Dataset Description: The dataset contains customer complaints with features such as product, sub-product, issue, company response, state, ZIP code, and dispute status.

Tasks:

1.Data loading and type checking\
2.Missing value analysis and handling\
3.Feature engineering (extracting day, month, year, and week from date received)\
4.Data visualization (bar graphs for disputes by product, issue, state, and company response)\
5.Model building and performance evaluation (LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, XGBClassifier)\
6.Prediction of dispute status for test data\

Deliverables:\
1.Python code for data analysis and modeling\
2.Predicted dispute status for test data\
3.Insights and visualizations from data analysis
